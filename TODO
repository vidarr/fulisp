* Bind lambdaCreate to 'lambda' aymbol

Done

* Work out reader test: Read in expressions, compare string print of reader
  result to expected strings

* Print out function pointers correctly

* Reader should parse '+' and '-' into symbol '+' resp. '-' and not int:0

* Error: Introduce error-handling function to be called by pointer.
         Allow setting custom error function

* Environment: Make all functions take an Environment struct
               Introduce Environment into reader


* Merge sub structures of Reader directly into Reader to save resolution of
        pointer
