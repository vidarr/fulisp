fuLisp is a simple lisp interpreter. It provides a parser transferring strings into lists and an interpreter that evaluates lists according to the rules of lisp. The lisp dialect supported is the very core of most of the dialects around. There is only support for the very basic functions, but those allow to implement whatever functionality is needed in lisp itself. It is targeted at providing a minimalistic lisp environment that is turing - complete nevertheless.
